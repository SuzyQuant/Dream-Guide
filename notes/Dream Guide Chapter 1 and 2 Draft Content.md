**Introduction**

Welcome to Dream Guide!

Dream Guide is a project that aims to bring simplicity and clarity to the complex topic of dreams. We want everyone in the world to be able to understand the basic terminology of dream management, so they can take steps toward achieving their own dreams.

We believe that experiencing happiness throughout your life requires flexibility, openness, and adaptability. Being open to new experiences and taking risks are imperative to ensure you are driving towards the life you want. There will be times of discomfort but these are usually great moments of learning. This Dream guide will help you bring flexibility, openness, and adaptability to fullfill your dream.

Dreams are more than just wishes—they're also opportunities for growth and exploration. Everyone has a dream, but only some people realize theirs…and even fewer do anything about it. The fact is, not everyone knows how to go about pursuing their dreams. Too often, people get stuck in their comfort zones and forget about the big picture: where they want to be in ten years and what steps need to be taken today in order to get there.

Luckily for you, we've created this guide as an introduction to dreaming big and taking action towards achieving those dreams! By making use of the information in this guidebook, we believe that anyone can become a successful dreamer—and ultimately a successful person.

**Core Values**

In the world of Dream, there are core values that guide the way we think, act, and operate as an organization. 

These values include:

**Inclusion**: 

Inclusion is the belief that everyone has the right to be safe, to feel welcome, and to be respected. It means that we value the unique gifts of all people and recognize them as equals. We believe in being open-minded and willing to learn from others' experiences and opinions. We also believe it is important not to make assumptions about people based on their race, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, religion/spirituality, physical abilities/disabilities, or socioeconomic status.

**Growth Oriented**:

Dream is all about growth—personal growth and professional growth. We believe that self-development is one of the most important parts of life, so we want to create opportunities for everyone involved in Dream (both inside and outside our community) to grow in their skillsets and careers through mentorship programs like our internship program for college students interested in tech startups (called Reveltek). We aren't just about getting stuff done; we want to learn from each other and grow as individuals too. This is why we provide training opportunities for new employees who join our team, as well as ongoing training for existing employees who want to improve their skillset further.

**Excellent:**

We believe in doing the best job possible. It's not good enough to just be good—we want to be excellent. We're always striving to make each individual experience better than the last, and we won't stop until we've reached that level of quality. For us, Excellence means always striving for more and doing everything with passion. It takes courage to be excellent because often times it means stepping out of our comfort zones and trying something new; however it also allows us to grow as individuals and as a community.

**Fun**

We believe that, for an organization to be truly successful, it must be excellent in every aspect of its operations and deliver a positive experience for all stakeholders. At the same time, we believe that work should be fun! We know from experience that when people feel they're doing meaningful work with their colleagues they enjoy it more and are more engaged in their day-to-day activities.

**Caring and Well Being**

Dream is not just a career, but a way of life. We believe that people who take the time to care for themselves will be more effective, loyal employees and have better relationships. We also believe that people who invest in their health and wellness are more likely to be successful in life. We believe that all people should have access to quality healthcare and education, regardless of their background or financial status. We strive to educate our team on how they can improve their lives while working with us.
